### Access Modifiers 

They are used to impose access restrictions on different data members and member functions.

### Three types of access modifiers in Java

- Private  : A private member cannot be accessed directly from outside the class
- Public : members can be directly accessed by anything which is in the same scope as the class object.
- Protected :access level to the protected members lies somewhere between private and public.
  protected data members can be accessed inside a Java package
- Default :  The default access is similar to the protected. It also has package-level access


Example of Cop and Police

Private Gun, public CheckGun, Shoot is Private or Protected!
